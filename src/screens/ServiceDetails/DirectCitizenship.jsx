                          Citizenship-by-investment programs offer affluent
                          individuals and families the opportunity to acquire a
                          second or even third passport, granting them expanded

                          rights as local citizens. These programs typically
                          require a significant financial investment in the host
                          country, such as through real estate, business
                          ventures, or government bonds, in exchange for
                          citizenship. The benefits of these programs extend
                          beyond the ability to travel visa-free to various
                          countries; they also provide access to improved
