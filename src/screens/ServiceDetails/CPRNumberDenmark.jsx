  <h2>
    <strong> What is a CPR Number? </strong>
  </h2>

  <p className=" tw-text-gray">
    A CPR (Centrale Personregister) number is a unique identification number in Denmark. It is essential for individuals residing in Denmark as it facilitates seamless access to numerous public and private services. With a CPR number, you can register for healthcare, open a bank account, access insurance, and even borrow books at the library.

        <strong>Ten-Digit Identifier:</strong> The CPR number is a ten-digit identifier used across various Danish national systems and databases. The first six digits correspond to your date of birth, while the last four form your unique identification. The last digit of the CPR number also indicates gender: odd numbers denote male and even numbers denote female.

        <strong>Why Do You Need a CPR Number?</strong> Residents in Denmark are legally obligated to have a CPR number as it is essential for:
        <ul className="tw-pl-5">
          <li>Accessing healthcare services.</li>
          <li>Opening a bank account.</li>

          <li>Accessing most public services and signing up for digital services such as e-Boks and NemID.</li>
