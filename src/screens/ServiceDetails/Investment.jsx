                    that where you want to invest in, you should grab the

                    When it comes to using digital technologies to foster
                    sustainable growth, productivity and social development,
                    Swedenâ€™s performance is second to none. Sweden has made a
                    strong commitment to apply new technologies such as AI and
                    IoT to solve larger societal challenges, while retaining
                    values such as openness, collaboration, integrity and

                    comes to e-commerce and building sales over the internet.
                    The contribution of the ICT industry to Swedenâ€™s economy, as
                    a share of GDP, is among the highest in the world. In fact,
                    only Ireland generates a higher share of value add around
                    computer services. More than quarter of a million people in
                    Sweden are directly employed by ICT companies â€“ but there
                    are many more ICT professionals when counting all those
                    engaged in digitalising other industries. The digital sector
                    accounts for approximately 20 per cent of Swedenâ€™s GDP and
                    employs no less than 18 per cent of the working population

                    or centres of excellence, put new technologies to the test

                    Circularity and healthy, increasingly plant-based food have
                    become major focal points for todayâ€™s food producers.
                    Swedish food tech startups and many established companies
                    are now at the forefront of developing plant-based protein
                    products, using the Swedish agricultural tradition to
                    transform traditional crops like oat, peas and lupin into
                    new, healthy food and beverage products. Surveys have shown
                    that one in every five Swedes under the age of 30 identify
                    as either vegan or vegetarian which has spurred demand for
                    vegan brands.
